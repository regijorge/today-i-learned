### Async / Await
Inside a function marked as async in JavaScript, you are allowed to place the await keyword in front of an expression that returns a Promise
When you do, the execution of the async function is paused until that Promise is resolved.

The idea with async / await in JavaScript is to be able to write asynchronous code that flows like synchronous code.
