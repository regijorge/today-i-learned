## Composite Key

### Definition
A Composite Key (also known as a compound key) is a key that consists of two or more columns combined to uniquely identify a record.

### Core Idea
It's used when a single column isn't enough to guarantee uniqueness for a row, but a combination of columns is.

### Example
| StudentID (FK, part of PK) | CourseID (FK, part of PK) | EnrollmentDate |
|:-------------------------:|:------------------------:|:--------------:|
| S1001                     | C201                     | 2023-09-01     |
| S1001                     | C202                     | 2023-09-01     |
| S1002                     | C201                     | 2023-09-02     |
