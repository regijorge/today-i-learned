## Superkey

### Definition
A Superkey is a set of one or more attributes (columns) that, taken collectively, allows us to uniquely identify a tuple (row) in a relation (table).

### Key Idea
It's any combination of columns that guarantees uniqueness for a row. A primary key is, by definition, a superkey. However, a superkey might contain more columns than strictly necessary for unique identification.

| StudentID (PK) | FirstName | LastName | Email              |
|:--------------:|:---------:|:--------:|:------------------:|
| S1001          | Alice     | Smith    | alice@example.com  |

Possible Superkeys:
- {StudentID} (this is also the primary key and a candidate key)
- {Email} (if we assume emails are unique for each student)
- {StudentID, FirstName} (adding FirstName is redundant if StudentID is already unique, but the combination is still a superkey)
- {StudentID, FirstName, LastName}
- {Email, FirstName}
