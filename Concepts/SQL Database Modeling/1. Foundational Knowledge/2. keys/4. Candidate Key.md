## Candidate Key

### Definition
A Candidate Key is a specific type of superkey. It's a "minimal" superkey, meaning it's a superkey from which no attribute can be removed without losing the unique identification property.

### Core Idea
A table can have multiple candidate keys. Each candidate key is a potential choice for the primary key.

### Properties
- Must uniquely identify each row.
- Must be minimal (no redundant attributes).

### Selection of Primary Key
The database designer chooses one of the candidate keys to be the official Primary Key. The other candidate keys are sometimes called "alternate keys."

### Example
In our Students table, if both StudentID and Email are guaranteed to be unique and neither can be reduced further while maintaining uniqueness:
- {StudentID} is a Candidate Key.
- {Email} is a Candidate Key.

We would then choose one of these, say StudentID, to be the Primary Key. Email would remain a candidate key (and often would have a UNIQUE constraint applied to it in the database).
