## Foreign Key

### Definition
A Foreign Key *(FK)* is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table.

### Core Purpose
- Link Tables: Establishes a connection or relationship between two tables.
- Referential Integrity: Ensures that the data between related tables remains consistent. For example, you can't add an order for a customer that doesn't exist in the Customers table if a foreign key relationship is set up.

### Properties
- The values in a foreign key column must match existing values in the primary key column of the referenced table, or they can be NULL (if allowed by the schema, meaning the relationship is optional for that record).
- A table can have multiple foreign keys, referencing different tables or even the same table (self-referencing relationship).
