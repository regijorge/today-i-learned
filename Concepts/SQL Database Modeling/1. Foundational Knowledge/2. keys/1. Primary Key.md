## Primary Key

### Definition 
A Primary Key (PK) is a column (or a set of columns) in a table whose values uniquely identify each record (row) in that table.

### Core Purpose
- Uniqueness: Guarantees that every row in the table is distinct. You can't have two rows with the same primary key value.
- Identification: Provides a reliable way to locate and reference a specific row.

### Properties
- It must contain unique values.
- It cannot contain NULL values (each row must have a primary key value).
- A table can have only one primary key.

### Example
| StudentID (PK) | FirstName | LastName | Email              |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| S1001         | Alice     | Smith    | alice@example.com |
| S1002         | Bob       | Johnson  | bob@example.com   |
| S1003         | Carol     | Williams | carol@example.com |
