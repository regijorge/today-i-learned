### I. Foundational Knowledge

1.  **Understanding Relational Database Concepts:**
    * [OK]  **Core Components:** Tables, rows (records), columns (attributes/fields).
    * [OK]  **Keys:**
        *   Primary Keys: Uniquely identify each record in a table.
        *   Foreign Keys: Link records in one table to records in another, establishing relationships.
        *   Candidate Keys, Superkeys, Composite Keys.
    *   **Relationships:**
        *   One-to-One (1:1)
        *   One-to-Many (1:N)
        *   Many-to-Many (M:N) - and how to implement them using junction/linking tables.
    *   **Data Types:** Understanding common SQL data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN, DECIMAL) and when to use them.
    *   **NULL Values:** Understanding their meaning and implications.

2.  **Basic SQL (Structured Query Language):**
    *   `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` clauses for data retrieval.
    *   `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` for data manipulation.
    *   `JOIN` operations (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`) for combining data from multiple tables.
    *   `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`).
    *   `ORDER BY` for sorting results.
    *   `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE` for schema definition.

### II. Core Data Modeling Principles

3.  **Normalization:**
    *   **Purpose:** Reduce data redundancy, improve data integrity, and avoid update/delete/insert anomalies.
    *   **Normal Forms (NF):**
        *   First Normal Form (1NF): Atomic values, no repeating groups.
        *   Second Normal Form (2NF): 1NF + no partial dependencies (all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key).
        *   Third Normal Form (3NF): 2NF + no transitive dependencies (non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes).
        *   Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): A stricter version of 3NF.
    *   **Denormalization:** Understand when and why to intentionally introduce redundancy for performance reasons (e.g., in data warehousing).

4.  **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs):**
    *   **Purpose:** Visually represent the structure of a database.
    *   **Components:**
        *   Entities: Real-world objects or concepts (e.g., Customer, Product, Order).
        *   Attributes: Properties of entities (e.g., CustomerName, ProductPrice).
        *   Relationships: How entities are connected (e.g., a Customer *places* an Order).
    *   **Notations:** Familiarize yourself with common ERD notations (e.g., Crow's Foot, Chen, UML).
    *   **Cardinality & Optionality:** Defining the numerical relationship between entities (e.g., one customer can have many orders; an order must belong to one customer).

5.  **Data Modeling Levels:**
    *   **Conceptual Data Model:** High-level view, identifies key entities and relationships. Business-focused.
    *   **Logical Data Model:** More detailed, includes all entities, attributes, keys, and relationships. Independent of a specific database system. This is where normalization is heavily applied.
    *   **Physical Data Model:** Specific to a chosen database management system (DBMS). Includes data types, indexes, constraints, and other physical storage details.

### III. Advanced SQL & Database Features

6.  **Indexes:**
    *   Purpose: Speed up data retrieval operations.
    *   Types: Clustered vs. Non-clustered, B-Tree, Hash, Full-text, etc.
    *   Trade-offs: Faster reads vs. slower writes/updates.
    *   Best practices for creating and maintaining indexes.

7.  **Constraints:**
    *   `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK` constraints to enforce data integrity rules.

8.  **Views:**
    *   Virtual tables based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
    *   Uses: Simplify complex queries, provide security (restrict access to underlying tables), present data in a specific format.

9.  **Stored Procedures & Functions:**
    *   Pre-compiled SQL code stored in the database.
    *   Benefits: Reusability, improved performance, enhanced security, reduced network traffic.

10. **Triggers:**
    *   SQL code that automatically executes in response to certain events (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on a table.
    *   Uses: Maintaining data integrity, logging changes, enforcing complex business rules.

11. **Transactions & ACID Properties:**
    *   Understanding transactions (a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work).
    *   **ACID Properties:** Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability â€“ fundamental for reliable database operations.
    *   `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`.

12. **Advanced Querying:**
    *   Window Functions (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`).
    *   Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for more readable and modular queries.
    *   Recursive CTEs for hierarchical data.
    *   Subqueries (correlated and non-correlated).

### IV. Design Patterns & Specialized Areas

13. **Database Design Patterns:**
    *   Handling Hierarchies (Adjacency List, Nested Set, Path Enumeration).
    *   Modeling Temporal Data (tracking changes over time).
    *   Audit Trails and Logging.
    *   Soft Deletes.

14. **Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence Concepts:**
    *   **Star Schema:** A central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.
    *   **Snowflake Schema:** A variation of star schema where dimension tables are normalized.
    *   Fact Tables vs. Dimension Tables.
    *   ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
    *   OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) vs. OLTP (Online Transaction Processing).

15. **Performance Tuning & Optimization (from a modeling perspective):**
    *   How schema design impacts query performance.
    *   Understanding query execution plans.
    *   Choosing appropriate data types to save space and improve performance.
    *   Strategic denormalization.

16. **Data Governance & Quality:**

### VI. Continuous Learning & Practice

19. **Real-World Experience:**
    *   Apply your knowledge to projects (personal or professional). This is crucial for solidifying understanding.
    *   Analyze existing database schemas and identify areas for improvement.

20. **Stay Updated:**
    *   The field of data management is constantly evolving. Follow blogs, read books, and participate in communities.
    *   Learn about NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) and NewSQL to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and when they might be preferred over or used alongside relational databases. This provides a broader perspective on data modeling.

21. **Problem-Solving & Communication:**
    *   Develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills to translate business requirements into effective database models.
    *   Practice explaining your models and design decisions to both technical and non-technical audiences.
